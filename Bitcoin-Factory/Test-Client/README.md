# Bitcoin Factory ML Test Client Application 

The ML Test Client runs from within the Superalgos Platform and connects to a remote ML Test Server run by community members. The server administers test cases by distributing them among users running the ML Test Client. These cases are then solved by the Test Client app. Once solved, the Test Client reports back to the Test Server with the test results. Once these results have been reported, the test server will send back a new test case, as well as the most recent forecast data. The new test case will then be tested, while the forecast data will be converted and saved to Superalgos as an indicator. 

It is important to understand that this Test Client APP does not prepare the dataset to be tested. This is done by the Test Server App. That means that this app does not need Superalgos or any other data provider for the purpose of extracting data from it. It only depends on the Test Server which handles the management of the Test Cases and the generation of the datasets to be used at each one of the tests.

### How does this Test Client App work?

This app is used to autonomously test different set's of parameters to see which Machine Learning models can produce better forecasts.

This is part of a system that also has a Test Server App and another app called the Forecast Client. The Test Server app manages a set of different Test Cases that needs to be crowd-tested.

Each Test Client app, connects to the Test Server app via a Superalgos Network Node. Once connected, it will enter into an infinite loop requesting new Test Cases from the Test Server.

Once a Test Case is received, the Test Client app will write 2 files at the notebooks folder (which is a shared volume with the Tensor Flow container):

* parameters.CSV
* time-series.CSV

After these files are written, the Test Client App will execute inside the TensorFlow container the Bitcoin_Factory_LSTM.py script. 

This script reads both files, and creates a ML model using the provided parameters and the data at the time-series file. Its execution could take several minutes. Once finished, a set of results are sent back from the Python script to the Test Client app, which in turn sends via the Superalgos Network node the results to the Test Server app. 

The Test Server app remembers all the test results and organizes a collection with the best crowd-sourced forecasts for each Asset / Timeframe. 

This consolidated collection with the best crowd-sourced forecasts is sent back to each Test Client as a response to their own report with the results of their latest test.  

The Test Client app receives this report, then sends it to Superalgos so that it can be saved as a regular indicator under the Bitcoin-Factory Data Mine. The Test Client app will then wait for 10 seconds and repeat the process again, requesting a new Test Case to test.


### Should I leave this Test Client App Running?

Yes, if you want to be receiving the crowd-sourced forecasts over time. Each new hour, you will get new forecasts obtained with the best crowd-sourced models available for each Asset / Timeframe. 

If you have this app running, you will be collecting all these forecasts and building over time historical dataset with the forecasts received. That could later be used for backtesting strategies which relies on these forecasts. 

If you already have a strategy that uses forecasts and you want to live trade with it, then you will need at least one Test Client App running to receive updated forecasts over time. If you run more than one Test Client at the same time, chances are that you will be updated with these forecasts more often, since the crowd-sourced forecasts are received after each test you make (which might take several minutes), having more than one app doing tests increases the frequency in which you get new forecasts.


### Superalgos Network

The Test Client and Test Server interact in a p2p way via the Superalgos Network, that means that we can run a Test Server at home and get help to process Test Cases from anywhere in the world without the need to pay for cloud servers, and almost without limits regarding the amount of people that can help. Only one Superalgos Network Node needs to run at the Cloud, and it will take care of connecting the Client with the Server.

## Pre-Requisites

* nodejs
* npm
* git
* docker

## App Setup

The current version of Bitcoin Factory is already integrated into Superalgos. You need to load the Bitcoin Factory Demo Plugin workspace, and from there you will run the Test Client task.

## Setting up your Superalgos Profile and the Task to run

To run this software you need a Superalgos Profile with some extra nodes and some configs to be in the right place. Continue reading for detailed instructions.

### Overview

For your Test Client App to work and be able to connect to the Test Server you need to:

1. Update your User Profile with several nodes that today you might not have.
2. Create the Signing Account node to allow your Test Client app to run with an identity that the Superalgos Network can recognize.
3. Reference from the Task -> Task Server App Reference one of the nodes you added to your profile.
4. Change a config to specify the name of your Test Client, so that you can recognize it among other test clients on the execution reports.

Continue reading this section for detailed step by step instructions of how to do the above.

### Update your User Profile

Before you can participate within the Superalgos P2P network, You need to add a few nodes to your User Profile. Once these nodes are added and configured properly you will need to contribute your updated profile to the Governance repo and make sure that it is merged by the PR merging bot. 

Here is the complete list of nodes you need to add to your profile and how to configure them. 

**Note:** All paths start from the User Profile node.

**Task Server App Node**
1. User Profile -> User Apps
2. User Profile -> User Apps -> Server Apps
3. User Profile -> User Apps -> Server Apps -> Task Server App

Once you have added the Task Server App node, hover over it and rename it using the following name: "Task Server App #1"

Then add the following configuration within the Task Server App node's config:
```json
{
    "codeName": "Task-Server-App-1"
}
 ```

**Bitcoin Factory Forecasts**
4. User Profile -> Forecast Providers
5. User Profile -> Forecast Providers -> Bitcoin Factory Forecasts

Hover over the Bitcoin Factory Forcasts node and rename it using the following name: "Testnet"

**Test Client Instance**
6. User Profile -> Forecast Providers -> Bitcoin Factory Forecasts -> Test Client Instance

For this node, you need to assign a unique name of your choice. The name you choose needs to be the same between the title and the codeName propety of the node's config. For example:

Node Title: "Assign-A-Name"

Node Config:
```json
{
    "codeName": "Assign-A-Name"
}
 ```

### Signing Accounts

Finally, you need to generate/re-generate the signing accounts of your User Profile, so that a new node of type Signing Accounts is created under the "Task-Server-App-1" node. The procedure to do this is the following:

1. At the Governance Project node create a Profile Constructor node.
2. Reference the Profile Constructor to your User Profile.
3. At the Profile Constructor menu, click on Install Signing Accounts. This will generate a new node under "Task-Server-App-1" and save a file to your My-Secrets folder with the Signing Accounts of your User Profile.

Congratulations! Now you are done with your profile.

Remember to save your User Profile plugin, contribute it and check that it was merged at the Governance repository.

**IMPORTANT:** It takes a few minutes for your profile to be auto-merged into the Governance repository and another 5 minutes to be picked up by the running Network Node. After changes to your profile, wait for around 10 minutes before expecting it to be able to connect to the Superalgos Network node.

### Reference the Task Server App

Go to Bitcoin-Factory-Demo Workspace, change it's name and save it (so to have your own instance of that workspace). Go to Plugins Node and then import your User Profile into the Workspace

Locate the node Task Server App Reference, under your Test Client Task, and replace the current reference with a reference to the "Task-Server-App-1" node you created at your User Profile. 

By setting up this reference you define the identity under which the test client will run on the P2P network. In other words, the signing account held under your "Task-Server-App-1" node acts like a finger print so that other entities running on the network can identify and work with your test client.

Locate the P2P Network Client node and reference the P2P Network Reference to the desired network (Testnet / Mainnet).

Reference the P2P Network Node Reference to the network node in use, you must import the user profile that contains the network node prior to referencing. The user profile may also require additional port configuration within the Network Interfaces Node.

### Change the Config

After that, open the config of the Test-Client Sensor Bot Instance. It looks like this:

```json
{
    "networkCodeName": "Testnet",
    "targetSuperalgosHost": "localhost",
    "targetSuperalgosHttpPort": 34248,
    "logTrainingOutput": false,
    "clientInstanceName": "Laptop-Lenovo-01"
}
```

* networkCodeName: We will use Testnet for now.
* targetSuperalgosHost: You can leave this with the default. If you wish to send the forecasted candles to a different instance of Superalgos, then change the host here.
* targetSuperalgosHttpPort: You can leave this with the default. If you wish to send the forecasted candles to a different instance of Superalgos, then change the port here.
* logTrainingOutput: Set it to true if you want more detail of the Machine Learning process at the console.
* clientInstanceName: **IMPORTANT:** Change this to match the name you gave to your Test Client Instance node you created at your user profile.

**IMPORTANT:** If you are going to be using 2 or more computers, you need to take care of the Signing Accounts file that needs to be present at both / all computers (This is the one that lives in your My-Secrets file). In other words, you cannot generate the signing account at one computer and then generate it again at the second one. If you generate it at one computer and contributed your profile, then you need to copy the file inside the My-Secrets folder to the second computer/s.

## Docker Setup

**Note:** If you haven't already make sure that you have installed python and docker on your system. 

Build the Docker Image. Open a console at the Bitcoin-Factory folder inside Superalgos and follow the instructions according to your hardware:

### On x86 Processors

```shell
cd DockerBuild
docker build -t bitcoin-factory-machine-learning .
cd ..
```

### On xArm Processors

```shell
cd ArmDockerBuild
docker build -t bitcoin-factory-machine-learning .
cd ..
```

IMPORTANT NOTES: 

* 1. You need to have a 64 bit version of your OS, otherwise this is not going to work.
* 2. In linux you might need to add 'sudo' before the docker build command.
* 3. The dot at the end of the docker build command is mandatory.
* 4. This build is required only once. Once your docker image is built you don't need to do it again unless there is a new release that explicitly tells you to do so.

## Usage

Now you are ready to get things rolling! You will need to open two terminals. One to run the docker container and the other to run the Test-Client Task within the Superalgos Platform.

- First run the Docker Container (See below in the "Instructions for each OS" section).
- Then run the Test Client Task located at the Bitcoin Factory Demo Plugin Workspace. 

### Docker Container Terminal Output 
Once the docker container is running correctly you will see at the first terminal an output similar to this:

```text

```

**Note:** At that terminal there is no further action required. 

### Superalgos Platform Terminal Output
At the Superalgos terminal, once  you run the Test Client Task, you will see, after 10 seconds an output similar to this one:

```text

└────────────────────────────────────┴─────────┴────────┘

```

**Note:** There are no more needed actions from your side. 

After between 15 and 30 minutes, depending on the Test Case that was assigned to you, you will see an output like this:

```text

```

Once you see this at least once, that means that your Client App is running 100% well and you should leave it alone. Even if you see messages that the server is not available, don't worry, the server might need to be restarted from time to time, your app will automatically reconnect and continue processing Test Cases when they are available.

### Multiple Instances of the Test Client Task

If you wish, you can run multiple instances of the Test Client Task. Clone the current Task and attach it to the same Task Manager to have more Tasks to run. Do not forget to change the bot configuration at each task to assign a different name to each one of them. 

You will also need multiple Test Client Instances at your Superalgos User Profile. Each instance name needs to match the config at the bot inside each task. 

Only one Docker Container needs to be running even if you run more than one instance of the Test App.

Depending on your hardware, your machine might do well with 2 or 3 instances running, monitor the CPU usage to see which is the limit for your specific hardware.

When you are running more than one instance, chances are that you will get the best crowd-sourced forecasts more often.

## Instructions for each OS

For specific information on how to run the Docker Container in different OS, please read the following sections:

**Very important**, if you choose to run docker under a sudo user on Linux distros, make sure you run Superalgos also under sudo, otherwise it might not work.

To run docker without sudo on Ubuntu, add the current user to the docker group with:
```shell
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
```
Then either log out and back in, or run the following command to refresh permissions:
```shell
sh
newgrp docker
```

### on Windows

Run the container with this command. Change the path if you did not install this App at the commands location.

```shell
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --shm-size=4.37gb --name Bitcoin-Factory-ML -v C:/Superalgos/Bitcoin-Factory/Test-Client/notebooks:/tf/notebooks -p 8888:8888 bitcoin-factory-machine-learning
```

### on Ubuntu Server / Linux

Run the Docker container with this command. Change the path if you did not install this App at the commands location.

```shell
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --shm-size=4.37gb --name Bitcoin-Factory-ML -v /Users/Your-User-Name/Superalgos/Bitcoin-Factory/Test-Client/notebooks:/tf/notebooks -p 8888:8888 bitcoin-factory-machine-learning
```


### on Mac OS

#### File Sharing

Before running the docker command for the first time, you will need to share the notebooks folder.

At the Settings of the Docker App, use File sharing to allow local directories on the Mac to be shared with Linux containers. By default the /Users, /Volume, /private, /tmp and /var/folders directory are shared. As this project is outside this directory then it must be added to the list. Otherwise you may get Mounts denied or cannot start service errors at runtime.

#### File Share Settings

To add the 'notebooks' Directory: Click + and navigate to the 'notebooks' directory.

Apply & Restart makes the directory available to containers using Docker’s bind mount (-v) feature.

#### Run the Container

The command to run the container on Mac should be like this (mind Your-User-Name).

```shell
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --name Bitcoin-Factory-ML --shm-size=4.37gb -v /Users/Your-User-Name/Superalgos/Bitcoin-Factory/Test-Client/notebooks:/tf/notebooks -p 8888:8888 bitcoin-factory-machine-learning
```
You will need to remove ```--gpus all``` for M1 based macs unless the docker image is specifically built to use the metal API.

## Troubleshooting - Docker Cheat Sheet

### Response from daemon conflict
If you get the error:

```text
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/Bitcoin-Factory-ML" is already in use by container ...
```

Use the command

```shell
docker container prune
```

to fix it.

### Network Client Identity
```text
"Fatal Error. Can not run this task. The Network Client Identity does not match any node at User Profiles Plugins."
```
This error occurs when the signing account does not match the Governance plugin repository's account. To ensure they are the same, import your user profile on the workspace using the "Add specified User Profile" command under Plugins -> Plugin Project -> Plugin User Profiles. 
Add the correct nodes, references and signing account to the plugin as detailed in [App Setup](#app-setup). Save the plugin and push the changes to the Governance repository and wait 10 minutes for it to merge and be picked up by the Forecast Server.

### Unexpected Error
```text
unexpected error trying to execute a python script inside the docker container"
```
This error relates to an incorrect path when launching the docker container. Ensure the path to the notebooks directory is correct in the docker run command. 

After launching the docker container, the path can be verified by using the following command to run a test model:
```shell
docker exec -it Bitcoin-Factory-ML python /tf/notebooks/Bitcoin_Factory_LSTM.py
```
