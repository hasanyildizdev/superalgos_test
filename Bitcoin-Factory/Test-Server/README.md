## To run a Test Case Server you need to setup two workspaces

Server Mining workspace.

Test Case Server.


For best results and to help keep things organised it is recommended to create a mining workspace.

## Create the Server Mining Workspace

1. Load up the getting started tutorials workspace
2. Rename the workspace to something related to the server eg: yourusername-mining-servername
3. Delete the 3 tutorials
4. Locate the Plugins/Data-Mining node and "Add specified plugin data mine"
5. Add the specified data mine you plan to enable within the test server sensor bot, along with Bitcoin-Factory, candles and masters.
6. Save and reload the workspace.
7. Locate the Crypto Ecosystem node and expand then find Exchange Markets, Hover over BTC/USDT and select "Install Market".
8. Locate the data tasks node inside my computer node, then continue and expand BTC/USDT/Candles/Candles/Exchange Raw Data/Exchange Raw Data Sensor Bot and configure as follows:

```
{
    "startDate": "2017-06-01"
}
```
9. Delete every "resistances and supports Multi-Time-Frame-Daily" node leaving only "resistances and supports Multi-Time-Frame-Market" nodes on each data mine task node. This will help reduce unnecessary processing.
10. Run all project data tasks from the Data Tasks node.
11. Save the workspace you are finished with the Mining workspace.


## Server Workspace

**The server workspace can be accessed by requesting a default template from the machine learning telegram group.**

1. Edit Test-Server Sensor Bot Instance with the following and replace YOUR-SERVER-NAME with the name of your server:

```
{
    "networkCodeName": "Testnet",
    "targetSuperalgosHost": "localhost",
    "targetSuperalgosHttpPort": 34248,
    "serverInstanceName": "YOUR-SERVER-NAME",
    "timeSeriesFile": {
        "labels": [
```

2. If you are running multiple instances of Superalgos and require data transfer from instance then input the IP address of the Superalgos instance in the "targetSuperalgosHost": "IP-ADDRESS-HERE",
3. Edit each indicator you wish to activate like below.
Indicator with range "ON" must be mining and up-to-date (from mining workspace preferably)
```
            {
                "dataMine": "Delta",
                "indicator": "MFI",
                "product": "MFI",
                "objectName": "mfi",
                "propertyName": "value",
                "range": [
                    "ON"
                ]
            },
```
4. Create Task-Server-App from within your User Profile/User Apps. (If haven't done already)
5. Use the Profile Constructor to Install Signing Accounts. (If haven't done already)
6. If you have signed your account don't forget you need to save your profile and merge it with the plugins/governance/user-profiles develop branch on github.com
7. Reference Task Server App Reference to the task server app in your profile.
8. At the Task Server Task, add P2P network client, then reference the P2P Network Reference to either Testnet, Mainnet or your network node, P2P Network Node Reference to your network node, under Network Service node add Machine Learning and finally in Network Interfaces add Websockets Interface + HTTP Network Interface.
9. Start the Test-Server Task and check the console you should see something like this:
```
Superalgos TaskServer is Running!

Websockets Client will try to Connect to Network Node via Web Sockets ........ Trying to Connect to devosonder -> P2P Network Node #1 -> 99.81.83.180:18042
Websockets Client Connected to Network Node via Web Sockets .................. Connected to devosonder -> P2P Network Node #1 -> 99.81.83.180:18042

Congratulations the test server is now running !
```


##Test Server Config Generation Script

A script can be found at ```/Superalgos/Bitcoin-Factory/Test-Server/GenerateServerConfig.js```.
This script will loop through all data mine plugins and generate a new up-to-date test server config file.

#### Running Script

To run the script navigate to the files location in the terminal and run ``` node GenerateServerConfig.js```

After completion the newly generated test server config can be found at ```/Superalgos/Bitcoin-Factory/Test-Server/TestServerConfig.json```. 

The contents of this file can be copy/pasted into the test servers configuration inside of Superalgos. (don't forget to turn on the desired "ON" indicators!)



## Governance

Machine learning test cases are deployed to users and all test data is stored within your Bitcoin-Factory/Test-Server/YOUR-SERVER-NAME
It is important to note that you are required to keep this data and provide it in a report to allow the system to accurately account for all test cases solved by each user. Test reports are to be combined into a single report then merged into the Bitcoin-Factory/Reports folder with the naming style as follows:

Testnet-2022-05-27.csv


### Random Notes:

1. You can not turn off the minimun 3 labels: Candle Close, Max, Min and 1 Feature: Candle Open. At the Test Server config all this must be ON.
2. Remember that the Test Cases Array JSON file is generated once the first time the Test Server run and does not detect that this file exists. If you change the config adding or removing ON / OFF switches for indicators, you need to manually delete this file and the Forecast Cases Array file so that the Test Server generates it again. Failing to do so will produce errors executing the tests at the Docker container, since dimensions for reshapes will not match, since they were calculated at the moment this file was generated but the changed config produces datasets with other amount of data.
