# Public Cloud Instructions

Hosting the the public cloud is a great option if you are looking for a highly
scalable and reliable solution.

While Superalgos does not officially support any public cloud providers, there
are community projects that have been created to make it easy to deploy Superalgos
into the cloud. This page is a list of those projects.

## :small_orange_diamond: AWS

[Superalgos-Iac](https://github.com/khultman/Superalgos-IaC) is a terraform project
with the goal of making it easy to deploy Superalgos to AWS. As of Dec. 2022 this
project is still in development and is not yet ready for production use; however,
it provides a documented design that could be used to deploy Superalgos to AWS.
