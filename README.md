# :small_orange_diamond: Introduction

Superalgos is not just another open-source project. We are an open and welcoming community nurtured and incentivized with the project's native [Superalgos (SA) Token](https://superalgos.org/token-overview.shtml), building an [open trading intelligence network](https://superalgos.org/). You will notice the difference as soon as you join the [Telegram Community Group](https://t.me/superalgoscommunity) or the new [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CGeKC6WQQb)!

Superalgos is a vast project. The focus of this README file is the [Superalgos Platform](https://superalgos.org/crypto-trading-bots-platform.shtml). Please, visit the platform's page on the website for an overview of features and functionality.

![superalgos-readme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/106380124-844d8980-63b0-11eb-9bd9-4f977b6c183b.gif)

# :small_orange_diamond: Getting Started

Superalgos is an ever-growing ecosystem of tools and applications. This guide will walk you through the main ways to install the Superalgos Platform — the flagship application of the ecosystem.

Once you install and launch the app, a series of interactive tutorials take you by the hand and walk you all around the system while you learn the basic skills required to use the interface, mine data, backtest strategies, and even run a live trading session. It is highly recommended to do all tutorials, as they are carefully crafted to make your onboarding as easy as possible. 

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE:** Tutorials are the absolute best way to tackle the learning curve. You should do all tutorials before you start exploring other avenues on your own.

![welcome-tutorial-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/107038771-4a6bf100-67bd-11eb-92e0-353525a972a9.gif)

The tutorial uses Binance or Binance US as the exchange of choice. If you don't have an account with Binance or Binance US, you will still be able to follow 100% of the tutorial. When you get to the live trading section, keep going even if you don't intend to run the session. You may learn how to work with other exchanges later on. If both Binance and Binance US are blocked in your region, you will need to set up a different exchange from the get-go. 

# :small_orange_diamond: Installation Options

There are a variety of methods to install the Superalgos Platform ranging from docker installations and packaged application installations to fine-grained technical installations ideal for developers and contributors.  

We will briefly describe the options available. Click the link to go to the specific README file with further instructions for the installation method of your choice.

1. [Packaged and portable apps](README_Packaged.md) | This option is optimized for non-technical users and is by far the easiest way to get started with Superalgos. These are not suitable for development or for contributing.

2. [Docker deployments](README_Docker.md) | Docker installations are another avenue that allows for a clean installation. While a little bit more technical than the packaged applications, Docker offers the ability to install the platform in a clean and isolated environment. The standard Docker installation is not optimized for development or contributions, but some workarounds are offered.

3. [Developers and Contributors](#small_orange_diamond-installation-for-developers-and-contributors) | This is the default installation for developers that wish to dive into the codebase and contribute to making Superalgos better. It is also the recommended installation for non-developers who wish to contribute improvements to the Docs, translations, design work, and so on. Instructions are available further down this same file.

4. [Raspberry Pi](README_RaspberryPi.md) | Raspberry Pi installations are a great economical option for running a trading system. You will need to be comfortable with either options 2 or 3 above to proceed here.

5. [Public Cloud](README_PublicCloud.md) | This is a great option for those who wish to run a trading system in the cloud. You will need to be comfortable with option 3 above to proceed here.

> :white_check_mark: **ABOUT REMOTE INSTALLATIONS AND MINIMALIST HARDWARE:** Remote installations and minimalist hardware — both virtual and physical — are better suited for production deployments, where the use of the GUI is minimal. We highly recommend learning Superalgos in a local installation, on a full-size PC. Mastering the system takes time, and the use of the GUI to go through in-app tutorials is crucial during the learning process. Your experience will be orders of magnitude better if you follow this advice: leave remote installations and minimalist hardware for when you are ready to start trading live.

> :white_check_mark: **EXPERIENCING ISSUES INSTALLING SUPERALGOS?** If you're having trouble installing or running the app for the first time, do not open an issue. Instead, join the [Support Telegram Group](https://t.me/superalgossupport) and follow the instructions on the pinned message to ask for help. You may also join the [new Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CGeKC6WQQb), but bear in mind that the response time tends to be longer. Online support is provided by volunteers — please provide clear information and sufficient context about the issue you are facing, and be mindful of people's time.

If you wish to try the [packaged and portable apps](README_Packaged.md) or the [docker deployments](README_Docker.md), there is nothing of critical importance left for you on this README file. That said, the [Get In Touch](#small_orange_diamond-get-in-touch), [Other Resources](#small_orange_diamond-other-resources), [Contributing](#small_orange_diamond-contributing), and [License](#small_orange_diamond-license) sections are certainly of interest.

If you opt for the installation for developers and contributors, please keep on reading. Otherwise, click one of the other options above.

# :small_orange_diamond: Installation for Developers and Contributors

This is the purest, albeit more technical, way of installing Superalgos. It has no limitations to contributing, which is highly appreciated and rewarded with SA tokens, and gives you the most freedom for custom configurations.

All procedures (other than pre-requisites) are the same for Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Raspberry Pi terminal commands have been included for ease of use. Some edge cases are covered separately, further down this README.

## Pre-Requisites

### :one: Install Node.JS, Git, and Chrome

You will need the latest versions of Node JS and Git installed. You will also need a web browser to access the interface. Google Chrome is recommended because it is the most tested browser being used by the development team and power users.

Follow the installation wizards to install the latest NodeJS and Git. Make sure to follow all the default and recommended settings while installing Git. If desired also install Chrome.

- [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- [Google Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE**: If you wish to test the (partial and incomplete) TensorFlow integration, you will also need Python 3.

Additional notes about installing pre-requisites on specific environments and edge cases can be found in the [Pre-Requisites Notes](#small_orange_diamond-pre-requisites-notes) section in the Appendix.

### :two: Get Your Github.com Personal Access Token

You will need to get an access token from Github.com so that you may authenticate with the service from within the app and the terminal/command line.

If you don't have a Github.com account, please open one! Once you are logged in, go to the [New Github Personal Access Token Page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and create a new token.

Make sure you give it the repo and workflow scopes. Check the clip below for clarity:

![github-personal-access-token](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/161605002-734ddc2a-9cb1-49ec-ac6a-d127850ab64a.gif)

Once you get the token, copy it and save it somewhere in your local machine. You will need to retrieve it later on.

## Superalgos Platform Client Installation

Now that you have all the pre-requisites and optional environment configurations set up, we can get to the core installation of Superalgos!

There are four steps required to install Superalgos:

1. Fork the Superalgos Repository

2. Download the appropriate install script
  - install.ps1 if using windows
  - install.sh if using a linux based distribution, including OSX

Let's get on with it!

### :one: Fork the Superalgos Repository

Scroll the page to the top. Find and click the **Fork** button to create your fork/copy of this repository. 

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE**: On the page that opens when you click the fork button, Github gives you the option to fork only the master branch by default. You must remove the selection so that you fork all branches instead. Play the following video for clarity.

![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83468174/184506791-83a00c44-ddc4-4fa3-9bec-d738532555d7.gif)

To fork Superalgos you need a Github account. If you don't have one, go ahead and create it.

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE**: A Fork is required so that the setup scripts may build the app from multiple repositories, and also for your contributions to the project. The reason why Superalgos is free and open-source is that the project has set up a collective business in which all users may participate. The way to participate is to [contribute](https://superalgos.org/community-contribute.shtml) to make Superalgos better. The project's [native SA token](https://superalgos.org/token-overview.shtml) is distributed among contributors.

### :two: Clone Your Fork

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE**: You will need your Github username and the API token you created earlier.

__*Windows*__

Open a powershell terminal, navigate to the directory you want to Superalgos folder to live in

Copy and paste 

```ps1
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Superalgos/Superalgos/install.ps1 -OutFile ./install.ps1
```

Run the script with you Github username and API token `install.ps1 -username <username> -token <token>` 

This will check you ahve git and node installed, it will then clone your forked repository into a folder name Superalgos. The script will install all the node dependencies, fork and clone all the plugin repositories and install the global superalgos cli.

__*Linux*__

Open a command terminal, navigate to the directory you want to Superalgos folder to live in

Copy and paste 

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Superalgos/Superalgos/install.sh ./
```

Run the script with you Github username and API token `sh install.sh --username <username> --token <token>` 

This will check you ahve git and node installed, it will then clone your forked repository into a folder name Superalgos. The script will install all the node dependencies, fork and clone all the plugin repositories and install the global superalgos cli.

# :small_orange_diamond: Usage

## Partner Exchanges

The Superalgos Platform is exchange-agnostic, but [the project offers partner exchanges](https://superalgos.org/partner-exchanges.shtml) custom support and a curated onboarding experience for their customers. In turn, partner exchanges offer preferential trading fees and, in some cases, other benefits to Superalgos users.

Find more information on how to get the benefits, join the corresponding Telegram group.

| Partner Exchange | Benefits | Telegram Group |
|--- |--- |-- |
| AscendEX | VIP 2 (7.5 bip Maker, 8.5 bip Taker) | https://t.me/superalgosascendex |

Partner exchanges have custom workspaces for the onboarding of their users.

## Run the Client and GUI

### Using the shortcuts

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE**: This method launches the platform with the fallback workspace only. If you wish to launch with a partner exchange workspace, use the Command Line method instead.

If you ran `node setup shortcuts` while installing dependencies, then you should have a desktop icon that you can double click to launch the Superalgos application. A terminal window will show the server is running, and a browser window will open with the GUI.

### Using the Command Line

To launch the platform with one of the Partner Exchanges custom workspaces, go to the Superalgos directory and run the command as per the following table. You will learn about other options further down this page.

| Partner Exchange | Launch Command |
|--- |--- |
| AscendEX | `node platform Foundations 01-Onboarding-AscendEX` |

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE ABOUT ASCENDEX:** An issue with AscendEX API may prevent the Welcome to Superalgos tutorial to run as expected. We suggest you use the fallback/default workspace in the meantime. The issue was reported to the exchange and is currently being investigated. 

To run Superalgos with the default/fallback workspace, go to the Superalgos directory/folder and run this command:

```sh
node platform
```

Options usage:

```sh
node platform <options> <project> <workspace>
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minMemo` | Run with minimal memory footprint. This is critical for running on platforms with 8GB of RAM or less, like a Raspberry Pi. |
| `noBrowser` | Do not open the GUI in a browser. This is useful on headless servers where a UI is not available. |

To load a specific workspace on launch, add any option you may require, then the project, then the workspace. For example, to load the Blank-Template workspace of the Foundations project with no options:

```sh
node platform Foundations Blank-Template
```

The Client will run on your terminal and the GUI will launch on your default browser. If Chrome/Safari is not your default browser, copy the URL, close the browser, open Chrome/Safari, and paste the URL. Be patient... it takes a few seconds to fully load the GUI.

## Usage Notes

We are testing the UI on Google Chrome and Safari on macOS only. It may work on other browsers as well — or not. If you are running on a different browser and ever need support, make sure you mention that fact upfront, or even better, try on Chrome/Safari first.

> :white_check_mark: **TIP**: If your computer has 8 GB of RAM or less, use `node platform minMemo` to run the system with minimal RAM requirements.

# :small_orange_diamond: Uninstall

Superalgos writes nothing outside of the `Superalgos` folder other than shortcut files. To quickly remove the shortcut files, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your main Superalgos directory, and type the following command:

```sh
node uninstall
```

Then simply delete the `Superalgos` folder to completely remove the application.

# APPENDIX

# :small_orange_diamond: Workspace Refactoring for Version 1

Version 1.2.0 carries with it a reorganization of the codebase where several projects were extracted from Foundations: Data-Mining, Algorithmic Trading, Machine Learning, and Community Plugins.

This means that these projects can now have a project leader and a team working on them.

To get your custom workspace upgraded to be compatible with beta 13 you will need to make a few changes:

Project nodes need to be present in the workspace for things to work. The presence of the node of a project, somehow, enables that project features at a workspace. Go to the workspace node and click add missing projects.

At the Plugins hierarchy, new guys appear, each one with their own type of plugin. Meaning that every workspace needs to be manually fixed because, currently, all plugins are loaded from the Foundations node there. The fix is easy though, it takes 2 - 3 min to delete the child nodes from the Foundation node, and add the same plugins from the project they belong to now.

# :small_orange_diamond: Pre-Requisites Notes

## Windows Pre-Requisites

When following the windows installer for Git, it is very important to make sure that you follow all the recommended and default settings. One of the most important one of these can be found in the screenshot below:

![IMG_0764](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55707292/189213902-7f7b3642-545f-47a7-89fc-3c45971c885d.jpg)

### Optional Windows Pre-Requisites

For windows users interested in testing the (partial and incomplete) TensorFlow integration, you need to install Python.

- [install Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/).

Github Desktop is a helpful tool to manage Git conflicts and issues. You can install it using the following link.

- [GitHub Desktop download page](https://desktop.github.com/). Click the "Download for Windows" button and follow the wizard to install after the download completes.


## Mac OS Pre-Requisites Homebrew Installation

Rather than manually installing NodeJS, Git, and Python, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can be used to install the pre-requisites with minimal effort on Mac OS.  After you clone the repository, change the directory to the Superalgos base and install the requirements using Homebrew. 

There are two ways to use Homebrew.  The first is to type:

```sh
brew install git node npm python@3.9
```

The second is to use the `Brewfile` included in the code repository. After downloading, run this command in the same directory where the `Brewfile` resides:

```sh
brew bundle
```

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE**: You can use Safari or Google Chrome as your default browser. If you run into a bug in Safari, you will be asked to reproduce it in Chrome as the development team uses Chrome.

## Linux (e.g. Ubuntu, or Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS/Raspbian) Pre-Requisites

[Follow the Node.js package manager install instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for your distribution to ensure you are getting the latest version of Node.js. Many distributions only maintain an older version in their default repositories.

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE**: Python 3 is only required for testing the (partial and incomplete) TensorFlow integration.

```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_17.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get \
install -y \
nodejs npm git python3
```

You may verify the installed versions with this command string:

```sh
node \
-v && npm \
-v && git --version
```

If you are running headless (i.e. as a server without a monitor attached) then you do not need to install a web browser and you can follow the tutorial for information on connecting remotely to the server.

Alternatively, you can use [https://github.com/nymea/berrylan](https://github.com/nymea/berrylan) to set up a tool for using Bluetooth to quickly assign WPA2 access on a WLAN on a Raspbian based Distro. Nymea also has tools for automation of IoT products to allow setting up SuperAlgos as a timed function without needing to learn how to code.

> :white_check_mark: **IMPORTANT**: 
> 
> If you are having node version errors there is a chance you may need to read the information in the Debian Pre-Requisites section and use NVM to handle node versions. This is due to some distributions having out-of-date repositories in the package manager lists.

## Debian or Debian WSL/WSL2 Pre-Requisites
(NVM & NPM Fix)

Debian distributions have been found to have some additional issues with installing the right version of NodeJS needed to run Superalgos. What follows are the steps to fix this issue.

For this to work you will need to [use NVM to install and control node] (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

- You will need to remove any versions of Node already installed on Debian due to the repositories currently being out of date.

- __This is necessary before proceeding.__ 

```sh
sudo apt remove nodejs -y
```

```sh
sudo apt \
update && apt upgrade \
-y sudo apt \
install npm -y
```

```sh
sudo apt \
autoremove -y && \
sudo apt autoclean -y
```

```sh
sudo curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

_Without running the next 3 commands, you will need to logout off your shell/WSL2 user account before you are to use NVM_
 
```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
```

```sh
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

```sh
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

_Make sure things are up to date and packages not needed are removed_


```sh
sudo apt update &&\
sudo apt upgrade && \
apt autoremove -y
```

```sh
cd Superalgos
```

into the directory of SuperAlgos
and __run the install commands as follows__:

```sh
nvm run node <command string/var>
```

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE**: This is for node.js/node only, npm should work fine with Debian.

# :small_orange_diamond: Troubleshooting Dependencies Installation

## Edge Cases

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS INSTALLING TENSORFLOW DEPENDENCIES:** You may get an error at the end of the setup process. If you do, please follow the instructions following the error message.

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE FOR USERS INSTALLING MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF SUPERALGOS ON THE SAME MACHINE:** To avoid name conflicts between shortcuts, make sure to rename each Superalgos directory before running `node setup shortcuts`.

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE FOR USERS INSTALLING ON LINUX:** If after running `node setup` you are prompted to address issues by running 'npm audit fix' ignore this step.

> :white_check_mark: **NOTE FOR USERS INSTALLING ON COMPUTERS WITH 1GB OF RAM** Superalgos has just about outgrown computers with only 1GB of RAM. For Instance a Raspberry Pi 3 does run the Getting Started Tutorials, but over time (Into 2023) this may significantly slow and could even stop. If still wish to use a computer with only 1GB of RAM (you have been warned), you will need to use version 16.x of Node.js as version 18.x needs well over 1 GB of RAM during setup. 

## General Troubleshooting

If you are having difficulty running the node setup command here are a few common issues that may be getting in the way.

1. Check the version of node and npm you have installed. Make sure that you are running an updated version of node greater than version 16.6 and npm greater than version 5. You can check which version you have by typing `node -v` and `npm -v` into a command prompt or terminal. If your version numbers are below these, you can update your installation by following the instructions outlined in the "Node JS Installation" step above.

2. If you are installing Superalgos in an administratively protected directory you will need to do one of the following:

   - For Windows start your command prompt as an administrator.

   - For Linux and Mac Systems make sure to add the sudo command to node setup.  This will look like `sudo node setup`.

3. For Windows it is important that you have C:\Windows\System32 added to your global PATH.  For instructions on how to do this google "add to the path on Windows 10."

4. If you are getting a lot of 'unexpected' errors during node setup, try resetting npm using the command `npm ci --omit=optional` before running `node setup` again.

## Enabling Desktop Shortcut in Ubuntu

The majority of shortcuts that are installed will work out of the box. Desktop shortcuts on Ubuntu, however, require a few additional steps to set up. First, desktop icons need to be enabled within the Tweaks app.

- Check if Tweaks is installed.

- If not go to Ubuntu Software.

- Install Tweaks.

- Open Tweaks.

- Under extensions turn on Desktop Icons

![enable-ubuntu-shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55707292/117553927-f0780300-b019-11eb-9e36-46b509653283.gif)

> :white_check_mark: **TIP:** If you do not see the desktop shortcut appear right away you may need to restart your computer.

Finally, you will need to enable the desktop shortcut. Right-click Superalgos.desktop and select Allow Launching.

![allow-launching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55707292/117553933-fcfc5b80-b019-11eb-872c-4fad81b184d2.gif)

Now both launcher and desktop shortcuts will launch Superalgos like any other program on your computer.

# :small_orange_diamond: WSL2 VSCode IDE Environment Setup

VSCode is a popular IDE. This short section covers some helpful tips for setting up the IDE's development environment.

There are a few things that need to be configured to obtain full functionality from VSCode. These configurations will make it possible to run notebooks for ML/AI algos and turn VSCode and Windows into a development bench for working with Superalgos.

On windows:

- First, you need to install WSL and WSL2 [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) then reboot if prompted.

  - You may want to review the Docker WSL2 Backend information for VSCode as well before proceeding. [https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/docker-wsl2](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/docker-wsl2)

  - Install Debian or Ubuntu from the Windows Store, Setup the VM as instructed.
  
On windows and Debian:

To make managing these WSL instances a lot easier, we will now move to installing VSCode + Tools to allow for Dockerizing and rapidly deploying as well as editing and managing test/usage cases of Superalgos edit and forks you create and contribute.

- Install VSCode [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user)

  - Install the remote container and remote docker plugins/extensions for Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_installation) 

    - _You may want to spend time reading the specifics of this documentation on their website._ 
    
  - *When prompted* install shell shortcuts for right-click options, this way you can open Superalgos easy inside of VSCode.

> :white_check_mark: **IMPORTANT**: 
> 
> As mentioned above, you need to remove node.js/node from your system and install NVM if you are using Debian.
> Please refer to the information above for properly setting up node.js and npm on Debian systems with complications regarding versions of node.

Once the install finishes you can now use VSCode as an interactive IDE/Shell to access SuperAlgos, run Dockers for working with Superalgos, and more.

# :small_orange_diamond: Running Superalgos on a Headless Linux Server as a Daemon

If you're running Superalgos on a headless Linux server like a Raspberry Pi, you might want to run it as a daemon so it isn't attached to your current login session. The easiest, most standard way to go about this is probably using `systemd`. Most Linux distributions use it as the default init system/service manager.

Create a `superalgos.service` file looking like this (change `<user>` to your user name and `/path/to/Superalgos` to your Superalgos folder, for instance `/home/John/Superalgos`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Superalgos Platform Client

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<user>
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/Superalgos
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node platform minMemo noBrowser

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

There is no need to run Superalgos as root so we're running it as a user. The `minMemo` option assumes you're running on a small machine like a Raspberry Pi, while `noBrowser` makes sense for running daemonized. Now, you'll need to move the file to `/etc/systemd/system/` for it to be recognized. You'll need then to enable and start the service.

```sh
sudo mv superalgos.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable superalgos
sudo systemctl start superalgos
```
To check the service status
```sh
sudo systemctl status superalgos
```
To stop the service:
```sh
sudo systemctl stop superalgos
sudo systemctl disable superalgos
```

To see the output of Superalgos, use:

```sh
journalctl -u superalgos
```

or to follow the output with `-f`:

```sh
journalctl -u superalgos -f
```
